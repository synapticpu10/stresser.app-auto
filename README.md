additional info: so u dont bother me the chromedriver.exe might become outdated over a period of time
so you can get it from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads and just replace the one thats in the folder

also it works on most school websites and stuff and dont expect to shutdown google with this they have ddos protection ofc

wHy dOnT u jUst uSe tHe wEbsIte: this bot extends the limits from 180 seconds to 18000 seconds and if u do maths its 5 hours so u can kill site
for 5 hours and i will try to add a auto account swap or a automatic register idk
